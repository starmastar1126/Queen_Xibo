This is the **development branch** and represents the next generation of the Xibo CMS.

# Installation

Installing an official release is [described in the manual](http://xibo.org.uk/manual/en/install_cms.html) and in the
official release notes of each release.

# Developing

** Please only install a Development environment if you intend make code changes to
Xibo. Installing from the repository is not suitable for a production installation. **

Xibo uses Vagrant and Docker to ensure all contributers have a repeatable development environment which is easy to get
up and running.

The very same Docker containers are used in our recommended end user installation to promote consistency from development
to deployment.

To these ends this repository includes a `Vagrantfile` to spin up an environment.

## Prerequisites

 - Git
 - [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
 - Vagrant

## Clone the repository

Create a folder in your development workspace and clone the repository. If you intend to make changes and submit pull
requests please Fork us first and create a new branch.

```
git clone git@github.com:xibosignage/xibo-cms.git xibo-cms
```

## Install dependencies

Change into your new folder

```
cd xibo-cms
```

Install the external dependencies with Composer. Your local machine is unlikely to have the necessary dependencies
to install the packages, hence the `--ignore` switch.

```
php composer.phar install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

## Start Vagrant

```
vagrant up
```

## Installation Wizard

Visit Xibo in the browser and follow the installation instructions. The CMS will be accessible at `localhost`. When
asked for a database you should select to create a new database and enter these details:

 - Host: `mysql`
 - Admin User: `root`
 - Admin Password: `root`

When asked for a library location you should enter

 - /var/www/cms/library
 
## Package manager ( npm ) and module bundler ( webpack )

Configure NPM Package Manager (https://www.npmjs.com/) and build dist folder with Webpack (https://webpack.js.org/):

 - Install Node.js ( comes with NPM ) from https://nodejs.org/en/

 - Update NPM to latest version:
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

 - Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder:
```
npm install
```

 - Build the dist folder with:
 ```
 npm run build
 ```

## Under the hood

Vagrant has created a virtual machine, installed Docker on it and then provisioned 3 Docker containers for Xibo to use.
There is a container for the CMS web server, a container for the mysql database and a container for XMR.

Your cloned repository is mapped into the Vagrant VM under `/data/web` and the Docker container mounts this as
`/var/www/xibo`. Changes you make to the source code on your host machine are immediately reflected in the nested VM
and Docker container.

Database data is maintained in the guest VM and is persisted when the VM is power cycled (`vagrant halt / vagrant up`). For
convenience the Docker MySQL container exposes mysql on port 3306 to the Vagrant VM. You can therefore connect to MySQL
over SSH using `127.0.0.1` and the port/key file shown by `vagrant ssh-config`.
