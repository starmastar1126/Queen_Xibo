<h1>Layouts</h1>

<p>Layouts are the concept <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> uses to create
the visual aspect of your digital signage. Layouts are used to enforce a look or
branding on the display and allow for multiple pieces of information to be
presented on the display at any one time. Using regions and layouts, it
provides the ability to group items of content together into an &ldquo;order
of play&rdquo;. The advantage of this is you are able to synchronise
different types of content and guarantee that they will be displayed on the
screen at the same time.</p>

<p>Each Region on your layout has a playlist.
Playlists allow you to group together any number of different content types
together into a list which will be displayed in sequence.</p>
