	<h1>Layout Designer</h1>

	<p>Once you have created a new layout and click the "Design" button, you should see a screen like this:</p>

	<p><img alt="Layout Designer Screenshot" src="content/layout/Ss_layout_designer.png"
	style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
	width="548" height="416"></p>

	<p>Here we can see the new layout we have created. Since we based it on one of the Full Screen templates, you can see it is a 
	wide screen aspect ratio and has one region that fills the entire screen.</p>

	<p>A layout is made up of a background picture or colour. On top of that, one or more grey boxes are drawn - regions - 
	which can contain one or more media items (pictures, videos etc).</p> 

	<a name="Background" id="Background"></a><h2>Changing the Background</h2>
	<p>You can change the background colour or choose a background image if you wish. Click the Background button.</p>

	<p><img alt="Layout Designer Screenshot - Background" src="content/layout/Ss_layout_designer_background.png"
	style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
	width="557" height="245"></p>

	<blockquote>
	<h3>Background Colour</h3>
	<p>Select a colour from the list of available background colours.</p>

	<h3>Background Image</h3>
	<p>Choose a background image that has been uploaded already.</p>

	<h3>Resolution</h3>
	<p>Choose the aspect ratio of the layout. Since you used one of the Full Screen templates that came with <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?>, there is usually no need to change this.</p>

	<p>Try choosing a new background colour and click Save.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Resize Region</h2>
	<p>To resize the region, click and drag the handle on the bottom-right corner of the region to change its size;
	then click and drag within the region itself to move and reposition it any place on the layout canvas.</p>

	<p>You can also right click within the region and select "Options". A form with detail information of the region is loaded.
	You can then define the position and size of the region more precisely</p>

	<h2>Layout Designer Jump List</h2>

	<p><?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> has a small but useful enhancement - Layout Designer Jump List. This feature allows navigation between layouts that 
	a user has permissions to edit, without having to jump out to the list of layouts each and every time. It is accessible from 
	a new icon on the layout designer, called "Jump to"</p>

	<p>Once clicked, it presents a list of accessible layouts with a "Design" button - selecting the button will load corresponding
	layout into the designer window.</p>
