	<h1>Campaign Layout</h1>

 	<p><?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> supports scheduling more than one layout at once. Say you have two layouts, each that last a total of 40 seconds.
  	If you wanted them to show in sequence between 10:00 and 11:00am, you would schedule both layouts to run from 10:00am to 11:00am on the 
  	same display. The client will automatically switch between the two layouts every 40 seconds between those times.</p>
  
  	<p>In <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?>, this is done using Campaign that comprises multiple Layouts.</p>
  	<p>Note:<br />
    At the moment you cannot control the playing order of those layouts in Campaign.<br />
    The Campaign cannot be assigned as Default Layout for a Display, excpet to use it during Display schedule.</p>
