	<h2>Choosing the right template</h2> 
	<p><?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> comes with a selection of default templates that caters for most digital signage applications (e.g. LCD TVs, projectors, 
	portrait screens).</p>

	<p>The <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> client will make its best effort to fit whatever shape layout you choose on to the screen. However sending a client 
	a layout in a 4:3 aspect ratio when it is connected to a 16:9 TV wastes two bars on either side of your content.</p>

	<p>You should choose a template with the closest aspect ratio to the screen you will be showing the layout on. 
	Here's a list of typical displays and the template to choose:</p>

	<ul>
 		<li><h3>LCD/Plasma Widescreen TV:</h3>
 		LCD TVs tend to be either 16:9 aspect ratio. Try "Full Screen 16:9" first. If you find there are slim black bars to the top 
 		and bottom of your fullscreen content, try switching to "Full Screen 16:10".<br />&nbsp;</li>
 
 		<li><h3>Widescreen Projectors:</h3>
 		Widescreen projectors can be 16:9 or 16:10 so you'll need to try both and see which fits best.<br />&nbsp;</li>
 
 		<li><h3>Widescreen Computer Monitors;</h3>
 		Widescreen Computer Monitors are usually 16:10 but there are a few 16:9 ones out there. Try "Full Screen 16:10" first.<br />&nbsp;</li>
 
 		<li><h3>Computer Monitors:</h3>
 		Non-widescreen computer monitors are usually 4:3 aspect ratio. Try "Full Screen 4:3".<br />&nbsp;</li>

 		<li><h3>CRT Televisions:</h3>
 		Old TVs tend to be either 4:3 or 3:2 aspect ratio. Try "Full Screen 4:3" or "Full Screen 3:2" and see which fits best.<br />&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>

 	<p>There are also specialist versions of all the above displays that are turned on their side. Called "Portrait" displays, 
 	they are taller than they are wide. <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> supports all the above aspect ratios for portrait screens - 2:3, 3:4, 9:16, 10:16. 
 	Consult your display manufacturer to find out which aspect ratio to choose.</p>
