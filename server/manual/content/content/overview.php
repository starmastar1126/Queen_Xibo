        <h1>Content</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

		<p><?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> uses content to on layouts. The content library is a store of all the content that
		has been used on layouts in the past, and content to be used on new layouts.</p>
			
        <p>In <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> content refers to individual &ldquo;items&rdquo; that you want to be
        available for displaying.</p>

        <p>For example a picture is considered as a piece of content and so is a piece of text.
        Each piece of content has information relating to it that <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> uses to display it in the best way. You will be
        prompted to enter all the required information when you come to add pieces of content.</p>

        <p>Adding content on its own is not enough to actually display it on the screen, there
        are further steps required before this can happen (i.e. Layouts).</p>

		<p>From this content library page, content should be added before it is needed. However
		content can also be added when creating layouts using the layout designer.</p>
