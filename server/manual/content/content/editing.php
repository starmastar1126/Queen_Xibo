<h1>Editing Content</h1>
<p>It may be necessary to upload a new revision of some existing content. To do so the CMS provides an Edit dialog, accessible from the Action menu.</p>

<p><img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Upload new Revision" src="content/content/library_media_edit.png"></p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">If there is no edit button then you do not have permission to edit that content.</p>

<p>Once you have entered the information <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> requires, click on the "Save" button and your 
content will be added to <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?>.</p>
