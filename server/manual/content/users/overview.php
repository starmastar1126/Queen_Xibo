<h1>Users and Displays</h1>
<p>The CMS access is split into two roles - "things that create and manage content" and "things that consume content" - in other words, "Users" and "Displays".</p>

<p>A user is a person that logs into the CMS through the web portal, or via an application connected to the API and creates, updates and schedules content. A display is a physical device running one of the Display Client applications, which consumes the content.</p>

<p>The CMS has an extensive range of options for both of these roles, including groups, permissions and usage stats. These are discussed in this section.</p>
